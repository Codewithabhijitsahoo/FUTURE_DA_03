# FUTURE_DA_03
This project presents an interactive College Event Performance Analysis Dashboard built using Tableau. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness and student engagement levels across multiple college events such as the Annual Cultural Fest, Tech Fest, Annual Sports Meet, Seminar on AI, and Workshop on Cybersecurity.


# The dashboard provides key insights by visualizing:

-The number of students who participated in each event.

-Average ratings given by students per event.

-The most liked activities (e.g., Dance shows, Tech quiz, Fashion shows).

-Student feedback and suggestions like “Keep it more interactive” and “Add Q&A sessions.”

-Re-attendance interest, showing how many students would attend the event again.

By analyzing student preferences and feedback, this dashboard helps in improving future event planning, enhancing student experiences, and ensuring better resource allocation.
